# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.22.0 (2026-08-24)

### Fixed

* **Two-way session and grouping sync across 1P/3P modes:**
  * Remap `dframe-group-scopes` account UUIDs when translating between 1P and 3P profiles so group assignments are visible across mode switches.
  * Merge and deduplicate `order` dictionary arrays for each group so Claude Desktop renders sessions inside groups rather than falling back to "Ungrouped".
  * Replicate session `.json` files across all target workspaces (including default `00000000...` and active worktree workspaces).
* **Thinking block context sanitization:**
  * Pre-call guardrail hook automatically strips empty or whitespace-only `thinking` blocks from the messages array to prevent upstream `400: each thinking block must contain non-whitespace thinking` validation errors when switching between reasoning and non-reasoning models.

## 1.14.0 (2026-08-21)

### Changed

* Project renamed from `claude-any-model` to `claude-threepio`. CLI script, app directory (`~/.claude-threepio`), daemon service names, User-Agent strings, and all documentation updated. Like C-3PO, this tool translates between protocols — Anthropic Messages API to OpenRouter/OpenAI API — and it runs in 3P mode.

## 1.13.0 (2026-08-21)

### Added

* **Linux support.** The proxy daemon installs as a systemd user service on Linux (instead of launchd on macOS). All commands (`install`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `uninstall`) are platform-aware. Claude Desktop 3P mode config paths use `~/.config/Claude-3p/` on Linux and `~/Library/Application Support/Claude-3p/` on macOS. Claude Desktop fully supports 3P mode on Linux — same Electron app, same profile schema, same gateway configuration.

## 1.12.0 (2026-08-21)

### Added

* `./claude-threepio sync-sessions` command: two-way merge of session metadata and sidebar groupings between 1P (Regular) and 3P (Gateway) modes. Shows a stats preview and prompts before making changes. Runs automatically as a prompted step during `./claude-threepio switch`. Merges by `sessionId` (newer `lastActivityAt` wins on conflict), unions group assignments and starred sessions. Conversation transcripts are already shared via `~/.claude/projects/` and need no sync.

## 1.11.0 (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* Network sandbox in Gateway mode now works correctly. The Desktop 3P host reads `coworkEgressAllowedHosts` (workspace-level) to build the CLI subprocess sandbox allowlist at spawn time, not `allowedEgressHosts` (profile-level) alone. The gateway profile template and `configure_sandbox_network()` now write both keys.

### Removed

* Desktop Commander MCP install/uninstall support, including the `desktop-commander` CLI command, the post-install prompt, and all related functions. The gateway profile already enables built-in tools (Edit, Write, Read, Bash, Glob, Grep) via `builtinToolPolicy` and `disabledBuiltinTools`, making Desktop Commander unnecessary.
* Failed sandbox workarounds in `~/.claude/settings.json` (`sandbox.network.allowedHosts`, `disallowedTools` list). These were ignored by the 3P host and actively harmful (disabled built-in tools).

## 1.0.0 (2026-08-21)

### Features

* Initial release of Claude OpenRouter Models local gateway proxy.
* Automatic LiteLLM daemon and Claude Desktop 3P inference configuration.
* Live token pricing display in Claude Desktop model picker.
* In-app session migration from 1P to Gateway mode.
* Weekly automated OpenRouter model recommendation scans via GitHub Actions.
